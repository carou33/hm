# prxy â€” Network Gateway (skeleton)

This repository contains a skeleton for a large-scale network gateway ("prxy") as specified in the project prompt. The structure mirrors the blueprint: docs, infra, src, monitoring, ci-cd, misc, and setup scripts.

What you get:
- A one-page UI at the repository root (`index.html`) with a black background and purple search bar.
- A full project skeleton with placeholder files and directories matching the prompt specification so teams can begin implementing services.

Quick start (serve the one-page site locally):

```bash
# from repository root
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
# then open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser
```

Files and directories were created as placeholders. Replace placeholders with real content when implementing.
